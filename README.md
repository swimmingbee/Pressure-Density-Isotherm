# Pressure-Density-Isotherm
Python code that models the density behavior of a compound under different pressures and temperatures

Compounds behave vastly different under constraints of pressure and temperature. 
This python code models the density of any compound under user specified parameters. 
The python code was created from the Peng-Robinson equation of state. 
The user downloads the excel template sheet and enters all required (compound specific) and all desired (pressures and temperatures) parameters. 
The code loads the data in the excel file and calculates everything and plots the results with pyplot. 
The code also populates a new excel sheet with the calculated data - so the user can now continue with either tool (excel or python).
